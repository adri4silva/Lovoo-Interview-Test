# iOS take home test

Your task is to write an iOS native app which shows a list of top headline articles from different countries and categories. ( https://newsapi.org/ )

The user should be able to filter the articles by country, category and date. When he/she clicks on an article, it should open in a new view and display itâ€™s content. 

Please use the images provided by the API and some additional information to display inside your UI. Which information you choose, is up to you.

- The app design should be functional and adhere to the Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Offline handling/caching is optional
- The app should load additional articles when the user scrolls to the bottom
- If you use third party libs, use a dependency manager
- Please write the app in Swift

Your focus in general should be on a good app architecture, so keep in mind scalability, maintainability and also performance.

When you think it's ready for prime time, push your work to a public repo on Bitbucket or Github and send us a link.

Good luck!

# Things to improve
